'''Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the
sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be
computed using the formula:'''

n = int(input("Dame un numero pa sumarlo we: "))
num = 1

for num in range(n):

    n = num+n
    continue

print(n)
